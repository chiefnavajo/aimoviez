# Production Deployment TODO

## Security Notice

**Keys Revoked:** API keys were rotated after exposure. Ensure all environment variables are updated in:
- Vercel dashboard
- Local `.env.local` file
- Any CI/CD secrets

---

## ✅ ALL Security Issues FIXED

### CRITICAL (Fixed)
1. ✅ Vote DELETE race condition - Atomic RPC with SELECT FOR UPDATE
2. ✅ CSRF token predictability - Added crypto.randomBytes(16)
3. ✅ IDOR in creator endpoint - SELECT only public fields
4. ✅ N+1 query in profile stats - Efficient RPC functions

### HIGH (Fixed)
5. ✅ MiniLeaderboard infinite loop - Removed from useEffect deps
6. ✅ XSS in CommentsSection - Verified safe (server sanitizes + React escapes)
7. ✅ Missing database indexes - Migration created

### MEDIUM (Fixed)
8. ✅ Session lifetime too long - Reduced from 7 days to 24 hours
9. ✅ Memory leak in EnhancedUploadArea - Added Object URL cleanup
10. ✅ Memory leak in Dashboard keyboard handler - Fixed useEffect deps
11. ✅ Comment like/unlike race condition - Added in-flight tracking
12. ✅ Genre vote race condition - Changed to upsert
13. ✅ Rate limiting too loose - Lowered all limits
14. ✅ Clip status validation missing - Added in vote endpoint
15. ✅ File upload polyglot validation - Added dangerous pattern detection
16. ✅ Admin winner assignment not transactional - Added atomic RPC

## 📋 Required Database Migrations

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# 1. Vote DELETE race condition fix
supabase/sql/fix-vote-delete-race-condition.sql

# 2. Profile stats N+1 fix
supabase/sql/fix-profile-stats-n-plus-1.sql

# 3. Additional indexes from audit
supabase/sql/additional-indexes-from-audit.sql

# 4. Admin winner transaction
supabase/sql/fix-admin-winner-transaction.sql

# 5. Contact/Reports/Blocks tables (if not already run)
supabase/sql/migration-contact-reports-blocks.sql

# 6. Enable RLS policies
supabase/sql/enable-rls-policies.sql
```

## 📋 Deployment Tasks

### Set Sentry Environment Variables
Configure in Vercel dashboard:
- `SENTRY_DSN` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`
- `SENTRY_ORG`
- `SENTRY_PROJECT`
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`

### Set Up Uptime Monitoring
- **Endpoint:** `https://your-domain.com/api/health`
- **Method:** GET or HEAD
- **Expected:** 200
- **Interval:** 1-5 minutes

### Update Frontend for CSRF
Components making POST/PUT/DELETE should include CSRF token:
```tsx
import { useCsrf } from '@/hooks/useCsrf';
const { post } = useCsrf();
await post('/api/endpoint', data);
```

## 📋 CAPTCHA Setup Tasks

### Setup Steps
- [ ] Sign up for hCaptcha at dashboard.hcaptcha.com
- [ ] Add site to hCaptcha (localhost + production domain)
- [ ] Copy Site Key and Secret Key from hCaptcha dashboard
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Add `HCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Create feature flag in database: `require_captcha_voting`
- [ ] Test CAPTCHA locally with test keys
- [ ] Add env vars to Vercel dashboard for production
- [ ] Enable CAPTCHA feature flag when ready

### SQL for Feature Flag
```sql
INSERT INTO feature_flags (key, enabled, description)
VALUES ('require_captcha_voting', false, 'Require CAPTCHA verification for voting')
ON CONFLICT (key) DO NOTHING;
```

### Test Keys (for local development)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=10000000-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000001
HCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
