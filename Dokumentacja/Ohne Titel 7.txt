SCENE OVERVIEW

“Ultra-realistic first-person POV cinematic sequence through Wojtek’s eyes as he walks through a New York–style street during golden hour. The buildings are extremely tall glass skyscrapers reflecting strong orange sunlight. Shadows are long, sharp, and physically accurate. The air contains micro-particles illuminated by the setting sun. The shot is a single continuous take with no cuts.”

Camera = human-eye simulation



head sway amplitude: 1.5–2%

micro eye saccades: 0.2°–0.5°

refocus delay: 120–160 ms

natural blink rate: 1 blink every 4–6 seconds (optional, subtle)

Lighting:



warm golden-hour direct light

accurate bounce light from glass

NO bloom exaggeration

NO stylized flares

TIME DISTORTION PHYSICS (HIGH ACCURACY MODEL)

Time slows relative to distance from the girl:



Radius 15–20 m: normal motion

Radius 8–15 m: 50% slow-motion

Radius 3–8 m: heavy slow-motion

Radius 0–3 m: near freeze

Radius ≤1 m: absolute freeze

Important:



Only the girl can partially unfreeze independently

No magical particles, no glowing FX

All slow/stop effects must look purely physical, like heat distortion + temporal lag

THE GIRL APPEARS

We see her through Wojtek’s POV:



flowing red dress illuminated by sun

long blonde hair catching golden highlights

sharp green eyes with skyscraper reflections

elegant Eastern European features

confident, calm, mysterious expression

As she approaches, the layers of time-slow become more visible.



Crowd → slower



People closest → distort



Her → moves at normal speed

Wojtek’s Joker-like personality is hinted through:



playful head tilt

calm breathing

slight anticipatory tension

TIMELINE + CAMERA OPTIMIZATION

SECONDS 0–2 — POV street approach (approx. 35mm eye equivalent)

Crowd bustling at normal speed.


Time slow begins to appear at mid-distance.


Eye refocus shifts between foreground and her.

SECONDS 2–4 — Medium approach (50–85mm effect)

People behind her blur.



Her figure sharpens.

Camera sway minimal as focus locks.

SECONDS 4–5 — Freeze ripple event

A low-frequency distortion bends the air.


Sound collapses to deep silence.


Time freezes in layers down to 0.

FULL FREEZE MOMENT (ENGINE-PROTECTED VERSION)

Frozen elements must be:



pedestrians mid-step

spilled coffee suspended

pigeons mid-wing

steam frozen in twisting shapes

taxi halted inches above a puddle

ZERO motion jitter

ZERO afterimages

ZERO stylized VFX

Girl remains the only unfrozen element.

💥 PARTIAL UNFREEZE — THE THREAT MOMENT

Second 5–6

As Wojtek stops directly in front of her:



The girl suddenly snaps to life while everything else remains frozen.

Her motion is sharp, fast, clean, and realistic:

She reaches toward her dress as if grabbing a hidden gun.



Hand velocity: 0.15 seconds (fast, decisive).



Hair reacts to the sudden movement physically.

Emotional calibration:



eyes sharpen

micro tension in eyebrows

moment of danger

NO actual firearm visibility unless Sora decides; the gesture alone is enough.

✋ SECOND FREEZE — TRIGGERED BY WOJTEK’S HAND

Second 6–7

From POV, Wojtek raises his hand.



The moment his hand enters mid-lift:

Time freezes again instantly.



Her hand stops mid-draw

Hair frozen mid-movement

Face stuck in a mix of threat and recognition

Environment fully frozen

Only her eyes regain motion independently.

Her eyes shift upward to meet ours — slow, emotional, alive.

💗 THE INTIMATE CHEEK-TOUCH (HIGH-EMOTION MODEL)

Second 7–10

From POV:

Wojtek gently places the back of his fingers on her cheek.

Physics and realism required:



subtle indentation of skin

accurate subsurface scattering in golden light

micro tremble of his fingers (human realism)

NO blur, NO glow, NO stylized filters

Her frozen expression softens the moment he touches her.



Her eyes warm, pupils adjust slightly, breathing implied visually.

She looks deeply into Wojtek’s eyes with a mix of:



recognition

love

sorrow

familiarity across timelines

No sound except a faint low-frequency hum.

The shot ends lingering on this emotional connection.

🧩 ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (MANDATORY FOR MAXIMUM ACCURACY)

No magical particles

No glowing energy

No visible time waves except subtle heat distortion

No changing camera height except natural body motion

No random props

No scene teleportation

No visual artifacts when freezing/unfreezing

No auto-cut transitions — one continuous shot

Girl’s clothing must NOT distort unrealistically

🧷 FINAL TECH REQUIREMENTS

Photorealistic

8–12 seconds

First-person POV only

No separating camera from Wojtek

Smooth human motion

Shallow depth of field tuned to human vision

Physically accurate light behavior

Hyper-detailed textures: skin, eyes, hair, fabric

Slow-motion layers must be distance-dependent
